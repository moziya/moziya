abstract: >-
  I focused on advancing the intelligence of ensemble learning systems to effectively address complex datasets, particularly those with high-dimensional and noisy data. My efforts involved several key areas: 1. Optimization of subgroups through adaptive decision-making strategies, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the ensemble models; 2. Integration of diverse data sources within the ensemble system, ensuring robust performance across varying types of input data; 3. Application of fuzzy theory to manage noisy and high-dimensional data, improving the systemâ€™s ability to generalize and perform in challenging environments. This work significantly enhanced the capability of ensemble methods to handle real-world, complex data challenges.

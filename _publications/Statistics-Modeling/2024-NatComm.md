  We developed a multimodal framework to systematically map the multiscale mechanistic effects of somatic mutations in cancer. We analyzed 1,038,899 somatic protein-altering mutations in 9,946 TCGA tumors across 33 cancer types and identified 1,4444 significant 3D clusters throughout the Human Protein Structurome, of which ~55% would not have been found if using only experimentally-determined structures. We then identified 26 significantly interconnected modules that encompass ~8-fold more proteins than applying standard network analyses.

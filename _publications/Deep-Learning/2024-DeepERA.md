  A deep learning model effectively modeling and analyzing both sequential data and network data for high-accuracy drug-target interaction prediction. It increased the AUROC by 12% in challenging tasks and made predictions for ~29M drug-target pairs and identified 45K novel drug-protein interactions with high computational confidence.

  Led the project to utilize AlphaFold architectures (just brought the Nobel Prize in chemistry to its developers!) to build the first comprehensive 3D database of viral-human protein-protein interaction structures. We addressed a critical gap in the current AlphaFold-Multimer-based studies for the viral-human interactome by curating a comprehensive and specific benchmark set. From the constructed 3D viral-human protein-protein interaction database, we also explore interface patterns among different viruses, providing new insights into viral mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.

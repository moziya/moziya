abstract: >-
  Applied my previous pipeline, OMSV, to detect SVs from whole gemone maps of 154 individuals across 26 populations and conducted population-level analysis. The results through PCA study on a large-scale of data revealed the population patterns of SVs and provided biological and evolutionary insights.

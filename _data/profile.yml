  <p>I am a Machine Learning Scientist transitioning into ML Engineering, with a decade of experience in deep learning, time-series modeling, and large-scale data pipelines. I specialize in building <b>end-to-end ML systems</b> -- from data ingestion and model development to deployment, monitoring, and scalability in production environments. My background spans computer science, computational biology, structural proteomics, and healthcare analytics, where I’ve deployed <b>production-grade ML pipelines</b> that reduced experimental costs, improved predictive performance, and enabled real-world impact.</p>
#  <p>I am a <b>Research Scientist</b> passionate about solving complex problems using <a href="/moziya/publications#project-Machine%20Learning%20Algorithm"><b>machine learning</b></a>, <a href="/moziya/publications#project-Deep%20Learning"><b>deep learning</b></a>, <a href="/moziya/publications#project-Statistical%20Modeling"><b>statistical modeling</b></a>, and <a href="/moziya/publications#project-Time-Series%20Analysis"><b>time-series analysis</b></a>. I hold a Ph.D. in <b>Computer Science</b>, specializing in predictive modeling and algorithmic solutions for intricate data challenges.</p>
  
#  <p>My expertise lies in transforming data into actionable insights to drive smarter decision-making and foster deeper understanding. I enjoy tackling high-impact questions, from predictive biological and healthcare models to clinical data analysis.</p>
  
#  <p>Personally, I’m an <b>angler</b> who sees fishing as another quantitative research challenge—why not! Success, both in work and fishing, comes from building comprehensive models that capture key patterns.</p>
